# Welcome to my Dashboard!

Hi and welcome! Here you'll be able to see a little bit of my learnings about React-Admin, Material UI, Data Provider and RTK Query.

## Documentation

- [React-Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)
- [Data Provider](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/DataProviderIntroduction.html)
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)

## Run the Project

To run the project make sure you have these dependencies installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

You will need to use the following command to start the application

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

## Important

The endpoint with the CRUD functionalities is read-only and won't actually create/update/delete. To see if the requests are working, check the requests at the Network tab
